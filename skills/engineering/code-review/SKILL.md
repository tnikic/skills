name: code-review
description: Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along three axes — Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?), Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/PRD asked for?), and Coverage (does the change have the right kinds of tests?). Runs all three reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to "review since X".
---

Three-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards** — does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** — does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / PRD / spec?
- **Coverage** — does the change include the right kinds of tests?

All three axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

This skill assumes your harness can interact with a project issue tracker. If you're unsure, run `/bootstrap` to verify.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point — a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc. If they didn't specify one, ask for it.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here — not inside three parallel sub-agents.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.) — fetch each referenced issue.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A PRD/spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `docs/issues/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below — a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation — and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Identify the test strategy

Look for the project's test portfolio, in this order:

1. `docs/TESTING.md` — if it exists, read it. This is the authoritative list of expected test types for this project.
2. If absent, note that no test strategy has been declared — the Coverage sub-agent will infer from project signals instead.

Also locate the [test-type taxonomy](../tdd/test-types.md) — the Coverage sub-agent needs it to match project signals against test-type triggers.

### 5. Spawn all three sub-agents in parallel

Send a single message with three `subagent` tool calls. Use the `worker` agent for all three.

**Standards sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full — the sub-agent has no other access to it.
- The brief: "Report — per file/hunk where relevant — (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls — documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

**Coverage sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- If `docs/TESTING.md` exists, paste its contents — this is the authoritative expected test portfolio.
- If it does not exist, instruct: "Infer expected test types from project signals (Dockerfile, deploy config, CI config, `package.json` bin entries, existing test suite structure). Use the test-type taxonomy at `../tdd/test-types.md` — match project signals against each type's triggers."
- The brief: "Report: (a) test types expected for this change that are missing or have no corresponding test in the diff; (b) tests in the diff that look like the wrong type for what they are testing (e.g., a smoke test doing deep integration work, a unit test mocking everything and testing nothing); (c) if `docs/TESTING.md` is absent and you had to infer, note this — the project has no declared test strategy. Under 400 words."

The Coverage sub-agent does **not** create or write `docs/TESTING.md`. If it had to infer, it reports the gap — the TDD or improve-codebase-architecture skills own creating that file.

### 6. Aggregate

Present the three reports under `## Standards`, `## Spec`, and `## Coverage` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings — the three axes are deliberately separate (see _Why three axes_).

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). Don't pick a single winner across axes — that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

## Why three axes

A change can pass one axis and fail another:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**
- Code that is well-written and matches the spec, but a deploy-path change has no smoke test → **Standards pass, Spec pass, Coverage fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking another.
