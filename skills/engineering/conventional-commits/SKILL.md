description: Create well-formed Conventional Commits messages from staged changes. Analyzes the diff to determine type, scope, and body; presents the message for approval before committing. Supports auto-splitting multi-scope changes. Use when the user wants to commit changes, create a commit, or draft a commit message.

# Conventional Commits

Create commits that follow the [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification — a structured format that communicates intent through typed, optionally scoped messages.

## Steps

### 1. Detect changes

Run `git status --short` and `git diff --cached --stat`. What happens next depends on what you find:

- **Nothing staged, nothing unstaged** → report "nothing to commit" and stop.
- **Nothing staged, unstaged changes present** → auto-stage everything with `git add -A`. If the user specified paths ("only the parser" / "just the config files"), stage only those paths instead.
- **Changes already staged** → use them as-is.

*Completion criterion: the staging area has changes to commit, or the skill exits with "nothing to commit."*

### 2. Run pre-commit safety checks

Two checks run against every new or modified file in the diff. Both must pass before proceeding.

**Secrets scan.** Inspect the diff for credentials, keys, and secrets — API keys, private keys, connection strings with embedded passwords, access tokens, `.env` files that aren't templates. Judge semantically: a placeholder key in a README is fine; a hardcoded secret in source is not. If a tool like `gitleaks` or `detect-secrets` is installed, run it as a second opinion.

**Lint and format.** Check whether the project has lint or format tooling — scan for `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `lefthook.yml`, `package.json` lint scripts, `eslint`/`prettier`/`ruff`/`black` config, `Makefile` lint targets, or any linter configured in CI. If tooling exists, run the narrowest check that covers the changed files. If it fails, report the failures.

**When invoked from `/commit`:** skip lint and format — the commit gate already ran the quality gate (`check` target). Run only the secrets scan.

When either check fails, block the commit and report what was found. The user can override with "commit anyway" or "skip the checks."

*Completion criterion: both checks pass, or user explicitly overrides.*

### 3. Analyze the diff

Read `docs/conventional-commits.md` if it exists — it may define project-specific scopes or types. If it doesn't exist, auto-detect scopes from the codebase structure (top-level directories, package boundaries, major module folders).

For the diff, determine four things:

- **Type** — one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`. Infer from what the diff *does*: new capabilities → `feat`, bug corrections → `fix`, pure restructuring → `refactor`, test-only changes → `test`, dependency/script changes → `build` or `ci`, formatting/whitespace → `style`, documentation → `docs`, performance work → `perf`, catch-all maintenance → `chore`.
- **Scope** — if ≥70% of changed files fall under one scope, use it. Otherwise omit the scope. A scope is a short noun naming the affected area: `parser`, `auth`, `api`, `config`.
- **Body needed?** — two tiers. **Single line** for `docs`, `style`, `chore`, `test`, `ci`, `build`. **Body** for `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `revert`, and any commit with a breaking change. A body explains what changed and why; it is free-form, wrapped at 72 characters.
- **Breaking change?** — scan for removed public APIs, changed function signatures, dropped compatibility, config format changes. If detected, mark with `!` after the type/scope and add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (or use the `!` alone if the description captures it).

*Completion criterion: type, scope, body decision, and breaking-change detection determined.*

### 4. Suggest splitting (if applicable)

If the diff spans multiple scopes, propose splitting into one commit per scope — each a self-contained scope-based unit. Present the split plan:

```
I see changes across three scopes:

1. feat(parser): add array literal support
2. docs: update API reference for new parser syntax
3. chore(config): bump parser dependency version

Split into these three commits?
```

The user can accept the split, collapse into one commit (omitting scope), or adjust the groupings. If the diff is clearly single-scope, skip this step.

*Completion criterion: split plan accepted, or user chooses single commit, or step skipped.*

### 5. Craft the message

For each commit, build the message following the spec:

```
<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Rules:
- **Description** is imperative, present tense, sentence-case, no period at the end. It completes the sentence "This commit will…"
- **Body** (when tier dictates) explains *what* changed and *why*, wrapped at 72 characters, separated from the description by one blank line.
- **Issue relationships** — commit messages must not contain forge-specific issue-closing metadata such as `Closes #N` or `Refs #N`. Put the issue relationship in the pull request body instead.
- **Footers** — add `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` if a breaking change was detected and isn't fully captured by `!`. Separate footers from the body by one blank line.

*Completion criterion: one complete message per commit, formatted per spec.*

### 6. Present for approval

Show the full commit message(s) in a code block:

```
feat(parser): add array literal support

Introduce support for parsing array literals. Previously, arrays
would cause a parse error. This change handles square bracket
syntax and nested arrays.
```

Ask "Ready to commit?" The user can accept, edit the message inline, or reject. If they edit, show the updated message and confirm again.

*Completion criterion: user accepts the message(s).*

### 7. Execute

Run `git commit -m "<message>"` for each commit. By default, signing respects the repository's git config (`commit.gpgSign`). To commit unsigned — for batch jobs or overnight automation — the user (or a calling skill) can request unsigned, and you pass `--no-gpg-sign`.

If the user requested splitting, commit each message in sequence. If any commit fails, stop and report the error.

*Completion criterion: all commits created successfully.*

## Reference

### Project config

`docs/conventional-commits.md` is the optional project-level config. When it exists, it may define:

```markdown
## Scopes
- parser
- auth
- api
- config

## Types (extends default set)
- deps  # dependency updates beyond chore
```

The skill reads this file on every run. Defaults (the eleven types, auto-detected scopes) apply for anything the file doesn't override.

### When to pick which type

| Type | Use when… |
|------|-----------|
| `feat` | Adding a new feature or capability |
| `fix` | Fixing a bug |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons — no logic change |
| `refactor` | Restructuring code without fixing a bug or adding a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests only |
| `build` | Build system, dependencies, package scripts |
| `ci` | CI configuration, pipelines |
| `chore` | Catch-all maintenance that doesn't fit the above |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit |

When a diff fits more than one type, prefer the most specific one. A change that adds a feature and includes its tests is `feat`, not `test`.

### Body triggers

Include a body when:
- The commit is `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, or `revert`
- The change has a breaking change
- The *why* isn't obvious from the description alone

Skip the body when:
- The commit is `docs`, `style`, `chore`, `test`, `ci`, or `build`
- The description fully captures the change

These are defaults — a `docs` commit that restructures the entire documentation deserves a body; a `fix` that corrects a typo in a string doesn't. Use judgment.
